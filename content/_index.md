The simple truth is that software and websites in general are hard work, harder than they should be anyway. Everybody talks about tooling, but what you really need is a couple of good mules leaning into the load.

{{< fr img="hugo-and-tailwind" alt="The author out plowing with his mules, Hugo and Tailwind" >}}

My best mules are Hugo and Tailwind. I've spent a lot of hours with my hand on the plow behind 'em, so I'll leave it up to you imagine why the one on my right is called “Tailwind”.  I've tried oats and I've tried barley, but doesn't make much difference. Call it an occupational hazard.

A lot of the heavy lifting around here is done by Hugo, Tailwind, Lunr and Netlify. I'm in it for the content.

Being resource constrained is not entirely bad. Money allows us to buy our way up to another context, but sometimes it ends up just skipping opportunities for reducing costs by eliminating complexity.  When you don't have the resources, then  partnering up with a couple of old mules works out pretty good.  While your neighbor is missing the season trying to get his latest Kubernetes model turbo tractor running, Hugo and Tailwind will always be ready to get there with you, turning sod and breaking wind.
